# Trying to run XNU on Raspberry Pi 3 (BCM2835)

I am trying to run XNU/Hackitosh, if possible. You can support me for this project :)

## Roadmap

XNU:

- Compile Mach-O
- Compile ELF Kernel

Raspberry Pi:

- Maybe a Mach-O loader
- Load ELF Kernel

Hackintosh:

- Try to make an ARM64 macOS sysroot
